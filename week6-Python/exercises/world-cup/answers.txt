Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Simulations where N = 100000 or N = 1000000, get values of countries with 0% chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stablizaed after about 10000 simulations
